### A Reinforcement Learning project: teaching a quadcopter to hover, fly to a specific target with DDPG model
An unfinished project...
Environment: tensorflow (1.13.0), python 3.5
If running in the terminal, run `python main.py`
Jupyter Notebook: all the codes are pre-designed in the notebook.
#### If the tensorflow version is not compatible, please change `tf.nn.leaky_relu` in the `model.py` file to `tf.nn.relu`
